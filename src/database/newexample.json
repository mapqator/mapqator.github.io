Louvre has amazing art from all over the world, and from all time periods. Louvre is a must visit when in Paris. Tickets are also affordable.\nPS: If you are going to the Louvre for Mona Lisa I recommend getting there early and heading straight to her, or else there will be a long line to get a picture of her.",
